## Description
For this assignment I created an employee management system that is accessed through the CLI where the user is granted a list of options to choose from to
view, add, or update to the management system. I used index.js to run the main prompt to ask the user to select from a list of choices as well as the code
to then check the sql and run queries to then be displayed on the CLI. I also created a schema.sql and seeds.sql to create tables for employees, positions, and
roles/positions and to also have data to then be accessed or updated.

## Deployment

Here is a video of how it works:
